Title: Brand Positioning: The Consistency EngineGoal: To strictly differentiate the product from "AI Writers" and appeal to the TTRPG/LitRPG enthusiast.1. The Prime DirectiveWE DO NOT WRITE THE STORY. WE KEEP THE STORY STRAIGHT.This product is a tool for Architects, not a shortcut for Writers. Every piece of copy, marketing material, and UI text must reinforce this.2. Forbidden vs. Allowed TerminologyFORBIDDEN (Do Not Use)ALLOWED (Use These)"Writing Assistant""Consistency Engine""AI Co-author""Logic Layer""Generates text""Tracks state""Write your book faster""Build your world deeper""Creative partner""Rules Enforcer""Ghostwriter""Campaign Manager" / "Lore Keeper"3. The "Anti-Slop" StanceWe acknowledge the community's disdain for low-effort AI content. Our stance is that AI should handle the drudgery, not the art.Marketing Hook: "You write the prose. We remember the math."The Enemy: "Spreadsheets." We are not replacing the writer; we are replacing the 15 Excel tabs open on their second monitor.4. Addressing the "Creation" FeatureThe app can generate text (item descriptions, room flavor), but this must be framed as "Drafting" or "Prototyping," never "Finalizing."Correct Framing: "Stuck on a loot drop? Generate a draft stat block instantly and tweak the numbers to fit your meta."Incorrect Framing: "Let our AI invent cool magic items for you."5. Privacy & Ownership (The Shield)Messaging: "Your World. Your Drive. Local-First."Promise: "We do not train on your world bibles. Your lore never leaves your machine."Why: This is the strongest defense against "AI theft" accusations.6. User PersonaTarget: The "Crunchy" Author. The GM who loves systems. The writer who cares about encumbrance rules.Not Target: The "Idea Guy" who wants a button to make a book appear.
